## Fun facts about the site

- The dates on the stamps are all dynamic and are generated to reflect how they would be achieved in the game to a certain degree of realism.
- The Nook Miles counter in the top right hand corner let's you know how many miles you would recieve if you were to complete all nook miles challenges.
- The new tab appears on achievements that are new to the latest version of the game.

## Assets

The assets are all based on the original assets found in [Animal Crossing: New Horizons](https://www.animal-crossing.com/new-horizons/). I did not design these assets. However I did spend many days recreating these assets from scratch. If you would like to to use these assets on your own website feel free to do so, I just ask that you please provide a link back to [AC Miles](https://acmiles.com) for all the effort.

## Data

The initial data for the achievements came from [this wonderful Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13d_LAJPlxMa_DubPTuirkIV4DERBMXbrWQsmSh8ReK4/edit?usp=sharing) that is being maintained by many amazing community.
