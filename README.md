## Fun facts about the site

- All the stamp dates are dynamic and are generated to reflect how they would be achieved in the game to a certain degree of realism (northern hemisphere).
- The Nook Miles counter in the top right corner shows the total miles received once all achievements have been obtained.
- The 'New!' tab appears on achievements that have been introduced in the latest game update.

## Assets

The assets are all based on the original assets found in [Animal Crossing: New Horizons](https://www.animal-crossing.com/new-horizons/). I did not design these assets. However, I did spend many days recreating these assets from scratch. You can use these assets on your own website, but I ask that you please provide a link back to [AC Miles](https://acmiles.com) to acknowledge my efforts.

## Data

The initial data for the achievements came from [this wonderful Google Sheets data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13d_LAJPlxMa_DubPTuirkIV4DERBMXbrWQsmSh8ReK4) that is maintained by the amazing Animal Crossing: New Horizons community.
